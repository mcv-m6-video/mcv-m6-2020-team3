## Master in Computer Vision Barcelona 2020 - Module 6: Video Analysis


## Abstract

### Week 1

* Task 1: Detection metrics.
* Task 2: Detection metrics. Temporal analysis.
* Task 3: Optical flow evaluation metrics.
* Task 4: Visual representation optical flow.


In this week we setup the different metrics used and get used to the dataset
we used in the following weeks. 

### Week 2
+ #### Background estimation
  + Model the background pixels of a video sequence using a simple statistical model to classify the background / foreground
    + Single Gaussian per pixel 
    + Adaptive / Non-adaptive 
  + The statistical model will be used to preliminary classify foreground
 + #### Comparison with more complex models 


#### Task 1: Gaussian distribution and Evaluate
+ One Gaussian function to model each background pixel
  + First 25% of the test sequence to model background
  + Mean and variance of pixels
+ Second 75% to segment the foreground and evaluate
1.2 & 1.3: Evaluate results

#### Task 2: Recursive Gaussian modeling. Evaluate and compare to non-recursive
+ Adaptive modelling
  + First 25% frames for training
  + Second 75% left background adapts
+ Best pair of values (ùõº, ‚ç¥) to maximize mAP
  + Two methods:
    + Obtain first the best ùõº for non-recursive, and later estimate ‚ç¥ for the recursive cases
    + Optimize (ùõº, ‚ç¥) together with grid search or random search (discuss pros & cons).
#### Task 3: Compare with state-of-the-art and Evaluation
+ P. KaewTraKulPong et.al. An improved adaptive background mixture model for real-time tracking with shadow detection. In Video-Based Surveillance Systems, 2002. Implementation: BackgroundSubtractorMOG (OpenCV)
+ Z. Zivkovic et.al. Efficient adaptive density estimation per image pixel for the task of background subtraction, Pattern Recognition Letters, 2005. Implementation: BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 (OpenCV)
+ L. Guo, et.al. Background subtraction using local svd binary pattern. CVPRW, 2016. Implementation: BackgroundSubtractorLSBP (OpenCV)
+ St-Charles, Pierre-Luc, and Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau. Improving Background Subtraction using Local Binary Similarity Patterns. Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2014. Implementation: LOBSTER (github)
+ M. Braham et.al. Deep background subtraction with scene-specific convolutional neural networks. In International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing, 2016. No implementation (https://github.com/SaoYan/bgsCNN similar?)

#### Task 4: Color sequences
+ Update with support color sequences
