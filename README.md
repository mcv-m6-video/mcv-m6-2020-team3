## Master in Computer Vision Barcelona 2020 - Module 6: Video Analysis


## Abstract
### Week 1 Implementing dataset and evaluation metrics
This week we implemented the evaluation metrics(Intersection over Union (IoU) and mean Average Precision (mAP)) that have been used in all tasks again.

### Week 2 Object detection with Gaussian model
The main task is to use Gaussian models to model the background pixels of the video sequence to classify them as background / foreground.

### Week 3 Object Detection and Object Tracking

### Week 4 Optical Flow and Video Stabilization
